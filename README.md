Intuji Frontend Associate Challenge - Finance Dashboard

Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Intuji Frontend Associate Challenge. The task was to create an interactive web page for a Finance Dashboard based on a Figma design, using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. The project focuses on replicating the "Home" screen design, ensuring proper HTML/CSS structure, semantic tags, clear naming conventions, and responsiveness.

Features
Sidebar Navigation: A responsive sidebar with icons and navigation links (Dashboard, Schedule, Message, Analytics, Team, Profile, Settings, Help, Logout).
Header: Includes a search bar, user profile, and notification/message icons.
Overview Section: Displays cards for Balance, Saving, Expenses, and Incomes with icons, percentages, and links to details.
Saving Plan Section: Shows saving goals (e.g., Bali Vacation, New Gadget, Charity) with progress bars.
Analytics Section: Placeholder for a chart with a dropdown for time filtering (Weekly, Last Week, Today)
Recent Transactions Section: Lists recent transactions (e.g., Figma, Youtube, Spotify, Freepik) with amounts and status.

Tech Stack
HTML: Structured with semantic tags for accessibility and clarity.
CSS: Styled to match the Figma design, with a focus on proper class naming and shorthand properties
JavaScript: Included Chart.js for potential chart integration (not fully implemented in this version).
Font: Uses "Plus Jakarta Sans" as specified in the design.
